I am a software engineer with a strong focus on frontend development. I build scalable and performance-oriented user interfaces using modern technologies within the React.js ecosystem (such as Next.js, Zustand, and React Query). I have solid technical expertise in component architectures, state management, and application optimization.
I work effectively with RESTful APIs to manage data flow between frontend and backend. On the backend side, I am gaining experience in developing APIs, data modeling, and building authentication/authorization systems using Node.js and Express.js.
I am committed to clean code practices and apply SOLID principles to build sustainable, readable, and maintainable code structures. I prioritize user experience (UX) and strive to deliver high-performance, reliable, and scalable applications.
I value teamwork and am proactive in taking responsibility throughout project processes. I embrace a continuous learning mindset and aim to quickly adapt to new technologies to add value to the projects I work on.
